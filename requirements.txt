------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gui requirements start

the gui should readback the following data
temperature
pressure
time left in state
current state
water content
turbo pump speed
turbo pump temperature
turbo pump power

there should be buttons with the following functionality
start/stop the heating/cooling cycling
start/stop the turbo pump
start/stop heating
start/stop cooling
create plots from the most recent data set (this button should just run graph_stuff.py)

there should be fields to enter the following parameters
total number of cycles
heating time
cooling time
data logging rate
turbo pressure too high trip level
pressure to turn turbo on

gui requirements end

overall goal
this code controls a toaster oven allowing parts to be placed inside and then undergo thermal cycling 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
behavior requirements start
when program starts it should be measuring the temperature, pressure and monitoring the turbo pump. turning it on if pressure is ok and turning it off if its running and pressure is too high
the start/stop cycling button should start the automated heating and cooling cycles starting with heating.
if stop cycing is pressed it should stop cycling but the constant monitoring of the temperature, pressure and turbo pump should continue
data logging should only be when cycling is active
while cycling the temperature, pressure and rga scan data should be measured and saved at the specified rate



behavior requirements end
